# Assembly Learning

This repo contains the environment needed to write x86x64 assembly. Still in the early commits and not sure the direction I'm doing with this.

## Starting VS Code Dev Container

To start the VS Code Dev Container, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) to open the command palette.
3. Type "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container" and select the command.
4. Wait for the dev container to build and start.
5. Once the dev container is ready, you can start working on your project inside the container.

## Compiling

1. In the dev container, open a terminal and run `make`
2. To execute the program run `./hello_world`
